# Genetic Algorithm
This folder contains the code implementation of GA (Genetic Algorithm)


## GA implemented by Java
The codes in the folder of "JavaCode" consists of two parts:
- GA platform (gaControl, gaData and gaConfig).
- Application based on GA platform (guessWords, primesDecompression, linearEquation).


## GA implemented by Javascript
In the folder of "JavascriptCode", 
- there is no platform for GA, and all files aren't based on frameworks.
- currently, only 2 features are done, guessWords and equationSolver.
- the feature guessWords can guess any words consisting of ASCII characters.
- the feature equationSolver solves any equation, even the strange ones which are impossible to solve by hand.
